# Create-pytauri

The recommended way to start a new PyTauri project.  
Currently only has Vue support.

## How to use

Make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.

```shell
uvx copier copy https://github.com/ISOR3X/create-pytauri project_name
```

## To do

1. Create a venv, install the python package as a dependency (maybe as a separate command?)
2. Add example GUI (see [pytauri-vue-starter](https://github.com/ISOR3X/pytauri-vue-starter))
